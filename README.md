# Milestone Project Two - Memory Bay

For my second project to display my skills in JavaScript I have created a memory card game with a theme reflecting my favourite place to be this year, the beach.

I have used a mix of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create this interactive game.

# Testing

# Deployment
The project is hosted on GitHub Pages

The process involved:

* Host a git repository on GitHub.

* Create project in GitPod saving each big change for version control to GitHub.

* Open your project repository in GitHub.

* Click on settings.

* Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section.

* Click on source and select master branch.

* After the page refreshes you will have a link to your deployed website.

* Final product now hosted on GitHub Pages.

To deploy your own version of the website:

* Have git installed

* Visit the repository

* Click 'Clone or download' and copy the code for http

* Open your chosen IDE (Cloud9, VS Code, etc.)

* Open a terminal in your root directory

* Type 'git clone ' followed by the code taken from github repository

* When this completes you have your own version of the website

* Feel free to make any changes to it

* The website can be run by opening one of the HTML files within a web browser

* Visit the link provided

* Your website with any made changes will appear

* Saved changes to the website will appear here after refreshing the page

The benefits of hosting your website on GitHub pages is that any pushed changes to your project will automatically update the website. Development branches can be created and merged to the master when complete.

It may take a moment for changes to appear on the hosted website.

During development the site is written in VS Code. It is run using Live Server plugin for VS Code.

To help me create the memory game javascript itself, I watched this tutorial by 'freeCodeCamp.org' and used the tips while changing it to fit my own code and needs for the game https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZniVgo8U7ek

To create my timer function I took inspiration from the code found at 'https://tonnygaric.com/blog/create-a-seconds-countdown-in-6-lines-of-javascript'
